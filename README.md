# Differential Drive Robot Navigation
A WIP navigation system for a two-wheeled robot. And one that does not use ROS for a change!

Currently working on IMU and encoder-based dead reckoning, which will be eventually fused with LIDAR measurements via breezySLAM.

This project was tested on a Raspberry Pi 4.

## Installation

Instructions coming soon
